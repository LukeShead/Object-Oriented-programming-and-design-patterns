This will be a repo that will cover aspects on object-oriented programming, the design stage of developing and patterns within design


## What is Object oriented programming

Object oriented programming is a programming format that bases most of the functions and functionality of the program into certain objects that are within the program. By doing this it adds extra uses that can only be used when dealing with objects. OOP is more commonly used within the programs that are interactive like gaming programs as the objects and classes within them prove to be a more efficient way of developing them.

There are 4 main major principles to object oriented programming that must be understood before developing,

#### 1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the use of public and private classes to hide functions within classes, a great example is having a cat, the object, “cat” will need to eat in order to not be hungry, this would be shown by hunger being a private class and having a public class called “eat” to call upon the private function hunger to change it when or after eating. It is an easier way to call upon functions and/or classes to program certain functions within objects.

#### 2. Abstraction
I mention Abstraction after Encapsulation as it is usually seen as an extension of encapsulation as the two are closely intertwined, abstraction is the use of hiding the means of how a function works to the user in order to make the function much simpler to understand and user friendly. An example of this is a car, when the user turns on the engine, the user does not need to know what the car has to be done in order to get the engine to run only that they need to turn on the ignition. This is used within programs to ensure that there is no confusion for the user but and that the function can be easily accessed by all types of users.

#### 3. Inheritance
When creating objects, it is common to find many of the different objects to have the exact same or mostly similar classes and methods, a way to help a developer re-use these methods is inheritance, this is process of taking an object and taking the methods and classes within it and creating a “Child” object to take parts of the object and add its own if needed to make creating objects easier and cutting out processes that would take a lot of the time of the developer. An example of this is where you could have the object “person”, this object could have the classes “address” and “Name”, By taking this object you could you create the child object “Worker”, this class would use the same class “Name” and “Address” but add its own class “Job”. This can help a developer save time and re-use classes and objects easily.

#### 4. Polymorphism
